# Facial-Recognition-under-Variants-of-Light-Intensities
Detecting variants of human face under different light intensities, this project focus on modern Artificial Intelligence principles to learn human face recognition and later to test it on unknown data.
This project was built during Artificial Intelligence Course during Bachelors.
Concolutional Neural Network was used to train model.
Designed system is able to distinguish and detect faces under verities of light intensities 
with loss: 0.0068 & accuracy: 0.9985
Furthermore, to make it more user-friendly android application could be developed that takes these datasets and can draw accuracy of test image with feed dataset.
In the literature review, there were methods available which can only test facial recognition under same intensities of light. 
There was no specific paper found specifically on variants of light intensities. This paper is little effort to contribute towards that niche.
Goals and Objectives are to keep track of thieves
Security tool for personal devices
To provide efficient data to surveillance monitoring system
The main objective to work on this project is to contribute our little part to solution of problem of facial recognition, which is surely a vast field of growth and research. We narrowed it down to dataset under variants of light intensities by Yale. Convolutional Neural Network is used as prime component of the solution. Moreover, different libraries of Python 3, e.g. cv2, NumPy, keras, matplotlib, TensorFlow and O.S., are used. Different results are compared, followed by accuracy and error graph. This paper proposes a strategy for distinguishing facial regions by convolutional neural system. It concerns the utilization of the convolutional neural network to distinguish images and identify them in different light intensities. The methodology introduced in this paper yields better classiﬁcation execution in contrast with the outcomes obtained by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) and K–Nearest Neighbor (KNN).
